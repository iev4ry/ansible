**demo-1.yml** is an experimental playbook that configures ip interfaces, routing protocol (eigrp), and validates the topology. This lab would normally take a day to configure and throughly test. However, with Ansible setup is done in under 10 minutes! As a Network Engineer, why haven't I used Ansible sooner!!!!
